In our latest publication, we show how &lt;strong>software-defined overlay networks&lt;/strong> can simplify deployments and reduce complexity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>drasyl: From Peer-to-Peer Library to Software-Defined Networking Platform</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/from-p2p-to-sdn/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:44:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/from-p2p-to-sdn/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="origins-and-motivation">Origins and Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-1-0-released/">Five years ago&lt;/a>, our work on drasyl began within the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231201155219/https://sane.city/">SANE research project&lt;/a>, which aimed to enable decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving data sharing between citizens and institutions. Achieving this required direct, efficient, and secure communication, even across communication barriers prevalent on the Internet such as NATs, firewalls, and IPv4/IPv6 incompatibilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Established solutions like WebRTC, while functional, rely on layered protocol stacks (STUN, TURN, SIP, DTLS) that add infrastructure dependencies, complex handshake procedures, multiple points of failure, and increased connection latency. These characteristics did not align with our architectural and operational requirements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Software-Defined Overlay Networking for the Deployment of Distributed Applications at the Edge</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-dissertation-published/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 19:33:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-dissertation-published/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are pleased to announce that Heiko Bornholdt&amp;rsquo;s dissertation, &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Software-Defined Overlay Networking for the Deployment of Distributed Applications at the Edge&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, has been published.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This doctoral dissertation introduces drasyl and its foundational concept of software-defined overlay networks. drasyl was developed as part of this dissertation—or, as some might say, the dissertation was developed around drasyl!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bringing Computation Offloading to the Edge</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/edge-computing-thesis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:06:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/edge-computing-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s post is about the master thesis &amp;ldquo;A Secure Context-Aware Middleware for Computation Offloading in Untrustworthy, Open, and Dynamic Edge Environments&amp;rdquo; by Kevin Röbert.
In his master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, Kevin Röbert designed, implemented, and evaluated a system capable of offloading computations to the cloud, grid, and edge devices.
He integrated drasyl into the &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=tasklet+system">Tasklet&lt;/a> computation offloading middleware.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Accessing Smart City Services in Untrustworthy Environments via Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Overlay Networks</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/smart-city-services/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/smart-city-services/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce that our paper &amp;ldquo;Accessing Smart City Services in Untrustworthy Environments via Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Overlay Networks&amp;rdquo; has been published in the proceedings of the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)&amp;quot;.
Within this paper, we presented how our approach can be used to provide the foundations for a network of Smart City Services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Smart Urban Data Space for Citizen Science</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/sane/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/sane/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today we are talking about another use case for drasyl: &lt;a href="https://sane.city">SANE&lt;/a>. This use case is special for us because it finally made us decide to develop drasyl. The SANE project is now finished; therefore, we would like to present the project&amp;rsquo;s results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Integrity in Smart Urban Data Spaces</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/data-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/data-aggregation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s paper is about a master thesis that deals with in-network data processing systems.
Maintaining data integrity in in-network data processing systems is difficult.
While individual nodes can be assumed to cooperate in closed systems, malicious participants must be detected and dealt with in open networks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SkABNet: A Attribut-Based SkipNet built on drasyl</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/skabnet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 10:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/skabnet/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today we would like to present you another use case of drasyl: A colleague of ours developed a distributed data structure based on the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tr-2002-92.pdf">SkipNet&lt;/a> presented by Microsoft.
