&lt;p>This doctoral dissertation introduces drasyl and its foundational concept of software-defined overlay networks. drasyl was developed as part of this dissertation—or, as some might say, the dissertation was developed around drasyl!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bringing Computation Offloading to the Edge</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/edge-computing-thesis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:06:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/edge-computing-thesis/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s post is about the master thesis &amp;ldquo;A Secure Context-Aware Middleware for Computation Offloading in Untrustworthy, Open, and Dynamic Edge Environments&amp;rdquo; by Kevin Röbert.
In his master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, Kevin Röbert designed, implemented, and evaluated a system capable of offloading computations to the cloud, grid, and edge devices.
He integrated drasyl into the &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=tasklet+system">Tasklet&lt;/a> computation offloading middleware.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Integrity in Smart Urban Data Spaces</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/data-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/data-aggregation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s paper is about a master thesis that deals with in-network data processing systems.
Maintaining data integrity in in-network data processing systems is difficult.
While individual nodes can be assumed to cooperate in closed systems, malicious participants must be detected and dealt with in open networks.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
