&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-1-0-released/">Five years ago&lt;/a>, our work on drasyl began within the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231201155219/https://sane.city/">SANE research project&lt;/a>, which aimed to enable decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving data sharing between citizens and institutions. Achieving this required direct, efficient, and secure communication, even across communication barriers prevalent on the Internet such as NATs, firewalls, and IPv4/IPv6 incompatibilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Established solutions like WebRTC, while functional, rely on layered protocol stacks (STUN, TURN, SIP, DTLS) that add infrastructure dependencies, complex handshake procedures, multiple points of failure, and increased connection latency. These characteristics did not align with our architectural and operational requirements.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
