&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s post is about the just finished &lt;a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/dos/teaching.html#27562742">master project lecture about smart cities&lt;/a> at Universität Hamburg.
The project&amp;rsquo;s goal was the prototypical implementation of a navigation solution for wheelchair users.
For this purpose, a suitable route was selected with a wheelchair-friendly surface.
The data required for navigation is automatically collected by a sensor box that can be attached to wheelchairs.
This data is exchanged from wheelchair user to wheelchair user with the help of drasyl.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>drasyl 0.8.0 released with improved Hole Punching, Remote Controlling for CLI, and increased TUN Device performance</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-8-0-released/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 12:14:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-8-0-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/jack-anstey-zS4lUqLEiNA-unsplash.jpg" alt="aerial photography of road">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, we are excited to announce the release of drasyl 0.8.0 with improved hole punching protocol, remote controlling via JSON-RPC for &lt;code>node&lt;/code> and &lt;code>tun&lt;/code> CLI commands, and increased TUN device performance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>drasyl Discord Server</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/discord/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 18:39:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/discord/</guid><description>&lt;p>We want to let you know that there is now a drasyl Discord Channel!

&lt;p>This post presents another use case of drasyl:
During an &lt;a href="https://vsis-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/vsis/teaching/coursekvv/528">eight-day block course at the university&lt;/a>, a total of five student groups designed and prototyped key-value stores.
In the process, drasyl was used for communication so that the students could fully concentrate on implementing the business logic of the key-value store.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>drasyl 0.7.0 released with TUN Device Support and Faster UDP Hole Punching</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-7-0-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 12:14:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-7-0-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/clint-adair-BW0vK-FA3eg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Green rope meshwork">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s post is about the master thesis &amp;ldquo;A Secure Context-Aware Middleware for Computation Offloading in Untrustworthy, Open, and Dynamic Edge Environments&amp;rdquo; by Kevin Röbert.
In his master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, Kevin Röbert designed, implemented, and evaluated a system capable of offloading computations to the cloud, grid, and edge devices.
He integrated drasyl into the &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;q=tasklet+system">Tasklet&lt;/a> computation offloading middleware.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>drasyl 0.6.0 released with Support for Netty Handlers, Backpressure Mechanism, and Tunnel Utility</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-6-0-released/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 01:57:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-6-0-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/pexels-pixabay-210008.jpg" alt="Grayscale photograph of an empty tunnel">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce that our paper &amp;ldquo;Accessing Smart City Services in Untrustworthy Environments via Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Overlay Networks&amp;rdquo; has been published in the proceedings of the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)&amp;quot;.
Within this paper, we presented how our approach can be used to provide the foundations for a network of Smart City Services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Javadoc Website</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/new-api-documentation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 00:32:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/new-api-documentation/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/pexels-thisisengineering-3861943.jpg" alt="Woman Writing on Whiteboard">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To date, we have always referred to javadoc.io, when someone has asked us for a Javadoc of drasyl.
While javadoc.io is an excellent service, we ran into some limitations:
javadoc.io splits the documentation for each module.
Since more and more Maven modules are added to drasyl, the documentation has become more and more obscure.
From now on, we provide a combined Javadoc at &lt;a href="https://api.drasyl.org/">&lt;a href="https://api.drasyl.org/">https://api.drasyl.org/&lt;/a>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Smart Urban Data Space for Citizen Science</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/sane/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/sane/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/sane_logo.png" alt="SANE logo">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we are talking about another use case for drasyl: &lt;a href="https://sane.city">SANE&lt;/a>. This use case is special for us because it finally made us decide to develop drasyl. The SANE project is now finished; therefore, we would like to present the project&amp;rsquo;s results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>drasyl Network Explorer launched</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/network-explorer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 03:29:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/network-explorer/</guid><description>Starting today, we launched the website drasyl.network, where you can explore all the nodes that are currently connected to one of our public super-peers.
The website does not show the exact position of a node. It applies a &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; offset to the location. Thus, the location on the map corresponds only to the rough region of a node. If this still poses a problem for some of you, we are free to remove your node from the website upon request.</description></item><item><title>Data Integrity in Smart Urban Data Spaces</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/data-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/data-aggregation/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/pietro-jeng-n6B49lTx7NM-unsplash.jpg" alt="green and red light illuminated net">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s paper is about a master thesis that deals with in-network data processing systems.
Maintaining data integrity in in-network data processing systems is difficult.
While individual nodes can be assumed to cooperate in closed systems, malicious participants must be detected and dealt with in open networks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>drasyl 0.5.0 released with E2E Encryption, LAN Discovery, and TCP Fallback</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-5-0-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 23:39:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-5-0-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/pexels-life-of-pix-4291.jpg" alt="Brass Color Metal Padlock With Chain">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today we would like to present you another use case of drasyl: A colleague of ours developed a distributed data structure based on the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tr-2002-92.pdf">SkipNet&lt;/a> presented by Microsoft.

&lt;p>Today, we are excited to announce the very first release of drasyl 0.1.0.
drasyl is an open-source, general-purpose overlay network that is concurrent, resilient, flexible, and automated. It presents itself to the user as a transparent system that offers suitable discovery and awareness methods, mainly focusing on smart city and IoT devices.
Nevertheless, drasyl is not limited to smart city and IoT but is intended for universal use in all decentralized Java-based projects.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
