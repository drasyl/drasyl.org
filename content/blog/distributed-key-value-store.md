This post presents another use case of drasyl:
During an [eight-day block course at the university](https://vsis-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/vsis/teaching/coursekvv/528), a total of five student groups designed and prototyped key-value stores.
In the process, drasyl was used for communication so that the students could fully concentrate on implementing the business logic of the key-value store.

The result of one of these groups can be [reviewed on GitHub](https://github.com/Plytek/keyvaluedrasy).
Get in touch with us if you want access to the other prototypes.
