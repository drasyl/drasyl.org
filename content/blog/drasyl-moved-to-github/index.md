drasyl moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/drasyl/drasyl) as the primary development platform.
On the old [GitLab repository](https://git.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/sane-public/drasyl), we set up a mirror that is always in sync with the GitHub repository.
Pull requests and issues are now only accepted on the GitHub page. In addition, the old repository is now read-only.
