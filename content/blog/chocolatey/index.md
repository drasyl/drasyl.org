Following our [last year's announcement of bringing drasyl to Homebrew for Linux and macOS users](/blog/homebrew/), we're now [bringing drasyl to Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/drasyl).

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is "The Package Manager for Windows".
Therefore, it provides a very comfortable way to install/update the [drasyl CLI](https://docs.java.drasyl.org/cli/) for our Windows users.

<!--more-->

To install drasyl via Chocolatey, you need this command:
```bash
choco install drasyl
```

After installation completed, the `drasyl` command should be available.
Type `drasyl help` to get an overview of all available utilites.
