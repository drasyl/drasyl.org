Since our first release we provide documentation for drasyl, [which is located within the Git repository](https://git.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/sane-public/drasyl/-/tree/master/docs).
As of today, we have started to provide a dedicated website with our documentation, with the help of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), additionally at [https://docs.drasyl.org](https://docs.drasyl.org).
While our documentation is still readable via the Repository file browser, MkDocs gives as more flexiblity in creating a good documentation for you.

<!--more-->

While `https://docs.drasyl.org/` provides the Documentation for the latest release, you can also go directly to a version-specific Documentation.
Just click on the version below the menu und select the desired release.

Du kannst jedoch auch direkt die gew√ºnschte Version ansteuern:
* For releases (like version `0.3`) you just have to visit `https://docs.drasyl.org/v0.3`.
* For the current `master` branch you have to visit `https://docs.drasyl.org/master`.
