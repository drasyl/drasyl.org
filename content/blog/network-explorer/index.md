Starting today, we launched the website [drasyl.network](https://drasyl.network), where you can explore all the nodes that are currently connected to one of [our public super-peers](https://docs.java.drasyl.org/public-super-peers/).
<!--more--->
The website does not show the exact position of a node. It applies a "random" offset to the location. Thus, the location on the map corresponds only to the rough region of a node.
If this still poses a problem for some of you, we are free to remove your node from the website upon request. Furthermore, you are, of course, free to run your own network with your own super-peers.
