drasyl is now also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/drasyl/drasyl).
We will release all future drasyl versions on that page.
While we maintainers still use the [GitLab Repository](https://git.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/sane-public/drasyl) for development, we're open to contributions on GitHub.
