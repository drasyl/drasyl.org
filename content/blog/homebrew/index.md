[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is "The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)".
Therefore, it provides a very comfortable way to install/update the [drasyl CLI](https://docs.java.drasyl.org/cli/).

To install drasyl via Homebrew, you need this command:
```bash
brew install drasyl/tap/drasyl
```

After installation is completed, the `drasyl` command should be available.
Type `drasyl help` to get an overview of all available utilities.
