Our [**libdrasyl**](/blog/shared-library/) allows us to build performant and native wrappers for languages other than Java and without the JVM. Accordingly, we are happy to present you our first wrapper in Python. The wrapper includes the necessary binaries for easy integration and is available as a Python package at [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/drasyl/).

#### Usage
All that is required to use the new Python package is:
```
$ pip install drasyl
```

In Python, a simple `import drasyl` is sufficient to start using drasyl.

We are looking forward to seeing all your exciting drasyl-based applications<img height="16px" src="/img/drasyl.svg" style="margin-left: 0.3em;" alt=".">
