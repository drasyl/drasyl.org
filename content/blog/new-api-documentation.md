To date, we have always referred to javadoc.io, when someone has asked us for a Javadoc of drasyl.
While javadoc.io is an excellent service, we ran into some limitations:
javadoc.io splits the documentation for each module.
Since more and more Maven modules are added to drasyl, the documentation has become more and more obscure.
From now on, we provide a combined Javadoc at <a href="https://api.drasyl.org/">https://api.drasyl.org/</a>.

While `https://api.drasyl.org/` provides the Javadoc for the latest release, you can also go directly to a version-specific Javadoc:
* For releases (like version `0.3`), you just have to visit `https://api.drasyl.org/v0.3`.
* For the current `master` branch, you have to visit `https://api.drasyl.org/master`.
