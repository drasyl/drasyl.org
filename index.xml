&lt;p>Today, we are excited to announce the release of drasyl 0.9.0.
This release will bring drasyl natively to C and Python!
In addition, drasyl now ships with optional components allowing you to utilize the publish/subscribe messaging pattern, remote message invocation, decentralized membership management, and a distributed lookup service.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Package</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/python-package/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 21:17:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/python-package/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/david-clode-oJlt2XBWuWs-unsplash.jpg" alt="A python.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our &lt;a href="https://drasyl.org/blog/shared-library/">&lt;strong>libdrasyl&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> allows us to build performant and native wrappers for languages other than Java and without the JVM. Accordingly, we are happy to present you our first wrapper in Python.

&lt;p>drasyl moved to &lt;a href="https://github.com/drasyl/drasyl">GitHub&lt;/a> as the primary development platform.
On the old &lt;a href="https://git.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/sane-public/drasyl">GitLab repository&lt;/a>, we set up a mirror that is always in sync with the GitHub repository.
Pull requests and issues are now only accepted on the GitHub page.

&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s post is about the just finished &lt;a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/dos/teaching.html#27562742">master project lecture about smart cities&lt;/a> at Universität Hamburg.
The project&amp;rsquo;s goal was the prototypical implementation of a navigation solution for wheelchair users.
For this purpose, a suitable route was selected with a wheelchair-friendly surface.
The data required for navigation is automatically collected by a sensor box that can be attached to wheelchairs.
This data is exchanged from wheelchair user to wheelchair user with the help of drasyl.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>drasyl 0.8.0 released with improved Hole Punching, Remote Controlling for CLI, and increased TUN Device performance</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-8-0-released/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 12:14:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-8-0-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/jack-anstey-zS4lUqLEiNA-unsplash.jpg" alt="aerial photography of road">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This post presents another use case of drasyl:
During an &lt;a href="https://vsis-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/vsis/teaching/coursekvv/528">eight-day block course at the university&lt;/a>, a total of five student groups designed and prototyped key-value stores.
In the process, drasyl was used for communication so that the students could fully concentrate on implementing the business logic of the key-value store.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>drasyl 0.7.0 released with TUN Device Support and Faster UDP Hole Punching</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-7-0-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 12:14:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/drasyl-0-7-0-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/clint-adair-BW0vK-FA3eg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Green rope meshwork">&lt;/p>

In his master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, Kevin Röbert designed, implemented, and evaluated a system capable of offloading computations to the cloud, grid, and edge devices.

&lt;p>To date, we have always referred to javadoc.io, when someone has asked us for a Javadoc of drasyl.
While javadoc.io is an excellent service, we ran into some limitations:
javadoc.io splits the documentation for each module.
Since more and more Maven modules are added to drasyl, the documentation has become more and more obscure.
From now on, we provide a combined Javadoc at &lt;a href="https://api.drasyl.org/">&lt;a href="https://api.drasyl.org/">https://api.drasyl.org/&lt;/a>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Smart Urban Data Space for Citizen Science</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/sane/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/sane/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/sane_logo.png" alt="SANE logo">&lt;/p>

The website does not show the exact position of a node. It applies a &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; offset to the location. Thus, the location on the map corresponds only to the rough region of a node. If this still poses a problem for some of you, we are free to remove your node from the website upon request.</description></item><item><title>Data Integrity in Smart Urban Data Spaces</title><link>https://drasyl.org/blog/data-aggregation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://drasyl.org/blog/data-aggregation/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://drasyl.org/img/pietro-jeng-n6B49lTx7NM-unsplash.jpg" alt="green and red light illuminated net">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s paper is about a master thesis that deals with in-network data processing systems.
Maintaining data integrity in in-network data processing systems is difficult.

&lt;p>Today, we are excited to announce the very first release of drasyl 0.1.0.
drasyl is an open-source, general-purpose overlay network that is concurrent, resilient, flexible, and automated. It presents itself to the user as a transparent system that offers suitable discovery and awareness methods, mainly focusing on smart city and IoT devices.
Nevertheless, drasyl is not limited to smart city and IoT but is intended for universal use in all decentralized Java-based projects.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
